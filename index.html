                        <h1>Freelance Front End Developer</h1>
                        <p>Hello, I am an aspiring front end developer with a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, 
                        and JavaScript. I initially started out with mobile app development but have since switched 
                        to front end to try something new and I prefer it over mobile app development. I'm relatively new 
                        to web development and am still trying to learn the ropes, so please forgive me if there are 
                        any mistakes in my coding.
                        </p>

                    <h1>Goals:</h1>
                            <p> My goal is to become as adept at web development as I possibly can. To acquire as much 
                                knowledge of it and what it's comprised of and as much of its inner workings as possible. 
                                I know that it takes a lot, but I want to have my own webpage that frequented by hundreds 
                                of thousands of people and is one that comes recommended by those who visit.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        As I had previously mentioned, I am still new to the web development thing, so the top right of the 
                        screen that has the "About Me | Blog | Contact " in it, does not have functioning hyperlinks yet, 
                        so please do not try and click them.

                    <p>I just want to say that if you come across this page, please be nice if there's some way that I may
                         have done it incorrectly or it's just different from how you would do it, so if you do see these 
                         things, educate me, don't belittle me. Thank you in advance!
